+-------------------+------------------------------+
| Public IP         | [AN IP]                      |

```

## Customized stages
You can create a custom stage list creating a yml with the desidered stages. For example if you want to install a Nginx/Mysql machine you can delete the agent installation.

::: warning
All steps need to be run after credential steps that prepare the env, do not remove. The MySql step cannot be run twice if already installed, you need to purge installation and content.
:::

``` bash
./installer config
Writing customizable /root/sculptor/installer.yml
```
Here the example file.

``` yml
stages:
  - Credentials # Mandatory do not remove
  - SuUser
  - Motd
  - Ntp
  - Php
  - Packages
  - Sshd
  - NodeJs
  - Nginx
  - MySql
  - Redis
  - LetsSEncrypt
  - Composer
  - Deployer
  - Firewall
  - Crontab
  - CheckServices
  - Agent
```

You can additionally dump configuration stubs also, so you cand specify certain options forn nginx or other services; all date will be put in custom_templates folder.

``` bash
./installer config --templates 
Customized configuration already exists /root/sculptor/installer.yml
Writing template /root/sculptor/custom_templates/agent-deploy.php
Writing template /root/sculptor/custom_templates/agent-env
Writing template /root/sculptor/custom_templates/env
Writing template /root/sculptor/custom_templates/file2ban.conf
Writing template /root/sculptor/custom_templates/index.html
Writing template /root/sculptor/custom_templates/motd
